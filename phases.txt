🧭 PROJECT 1: Clean REST API (Security-Minded Build)

Tech choice (locked in):

FastAPI

SQLite

SQLAlchemy

JWT auth

curl / Postman for testing

No cloud. No frontend. No Docker.

🧱 PHASE 0 — Mental Model (30 minutes)
🎯 Goal

Understand what you’re building before touching code.

The system
Client (curl/Postman)
        ↓
FastAPI (routes + logic)
        ↓
Auth layer (JWT)
        ↓
Database (SQLite)

Core entities (keep it simple)

User

Post

Relationships:

User → many Posts

Post → belongs to one User

🧠 Security lens

Where does trust begin?

Which layer decides who can do what?

✅ Done when

You can draw this on paper

You can explain request → response flow out loud

🚫 Ignore:

Microservices

Async performance

“Best folder structures” blogs

🧪 PHASE 1 — Skeleton API (Day 1)
🎯 Goal

Get an API that responds correctly.

Tasks

Create virtual environment

Install:

pip install fastapi uvicorn


Create:

main.py

Add:

/health

/hello

Example expectations:

JSON responses

Correct status codes

🧠 Security lens

Attackers see responses, not your code

Consistent output matters

✅ Done when

uvicorn main:app --reload works

You can hit endpoints via browser/Postman

🚫 Ignore:

Auth

Database

Logging

🗄️ PHASE 2 — Database Layer (Day 2)
🎯 Goal

Persist data cleanly.

Tasks

Install:

pip install sqlalchemy


Create:

database.py

models.py

Define:

User

Post

Use SQLite:

sqlite:///./app.db

🧠 Security lens

Data is an attack surface

Schema design affects exposure

✅ Done when

Tables auto-create

You can insert and query data

app.db appears in folder

🚫 Ignore:

Migrations

Index optimization

Raw SQL tuning

🔁 PHASE 3 — CRUD Endpoints (Day 3)
🎯 Goal

Make the API useful.

Endpoints to implement

POST /users

GET /users/{id}

POST /posts

GET /posts

Add:

Proper status codes

Error handling (404, 400)

🧠 Security lens

ID-based access = IDOR risk

Error messages leak information

✅ Done when

You can create users/posts

Errors behave predictably

You can explain every endpoint

🚫 Ignore:

Pagination

Filtering

Search

🔐 PHASE 4 — Authentication (Day 4)
🎯 Goal

Introduce identity.

Tasks

Install:

pip install python-jose passlib[bcrypt]


Add:

Password hashing

Login endpoint

JWT generation

Protect:

POST /posts

🧠 Security lens

Authentication ≠ Authorization

Tokens are bearer secrets

✅ Done when

Login returns a token

Protected routes reject unauth users

Token expiry works

🚫 Ignore:

OAuth

Refresh tokens

Social login

🧭 PHASE 5 — Authorization (Day 5)
🎯 Goal

Control who can do what.

Tasks

Ensure:

Users can only modify their own posts

Enforce ownership checks

🧠 Security lens

This is where real API vulns live

Most breaches = broken authZ

✅ Done when

Cross-user access fails

You can explain why checks are placed where they are

🚫 Ignore:

Roles

Admin panels

🧼 PHASE 6 — Cleanup & Explain (Final polish)
🎯 Goal

Turn code into knowledge.

Tasks

Add docstrings

Clean naming

Write a simple README:

What it does

How auth works

Threats considered

🧠 Security lens

If you can explain it, you own it

✅ Done when

You could teach this to a junior

You can point to where security lives in the code

🚫 Ignore:

Fancy README badges

Overengineering
